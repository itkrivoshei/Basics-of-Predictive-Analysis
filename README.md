Welcome to [Basics of Predictive Analysis](https://replit.com/@itkrivoshei/Basics-of-Predictive-Analysis), an interactive project designed to predict rental prices and classify luxury apartments in Berlin using synthetic data. This project utilizes regression and classification analyses, integrated into a user-friendly GUI for easy selection and visualization of different tasks.

## üìö Project Overview

This project includes three main components:

| Number | Task                        | Description                                                                               | Code                                                                                          |
| ------ | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1.     | üè¢ Regression Analysis      | Predict rental prices of Berlin apartments based on various features.                      | [Code](https://github.com/itkrivoshei/Basics-of-Predictive-Analysis/blob/main/regression_analysis.py)    |
| 2.     | üè† Classification Analysis  | Classify apartments as luxury or non-luxury based on rental prices and other attributes.   | [Code](https://github.com/itkrivoshei/Basics-of-Predictive-Analysis/blob/main/classification_analysis.py) |
